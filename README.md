# Simple Redux Starter Boilerplate

This is a simple redux starter kit with all the awesome features like Hot Module Replacement, Webpack and the latest React Router 4.

# Why ?

I started this boilerplate after realising a need for the latest tooling. There are many great boilerplates, but if someone needs something very basic for learning purposes or building sample projects - this boilerplate might help those.

# Caution

This is a WIP. I will be adding more examples for using this boilerplate. Lookout for releases!

# Inspiration

This boilerplate is highly inspired by [Ryan Collins' Scalable React Boilerplate](https://github.com/scalable-react/scalable-react-boilerplate). You will find a lot of resemblances from Ryan's boilerplate, in this project. If you're looking for Reac+TypeScript boilerplate - check out his [TypeScript Version](https://github.com/scalable-react/scalable-react-typescript-boilerplate) of the same boilerplate.
